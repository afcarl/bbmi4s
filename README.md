# Basic Bayesian Modeling and Inference for Scientists

This is an experiment (scientists love them).  What is the
fastest way to working knowledge of Bayesian probabilistic
modeling and inference? Our working hypothesis is that it
requires lots of intuitive examples and hands-on coding
exercises, and relatively little theory. We have a few
guinea pigs to test this hypothesis on; we'll see if it works!
